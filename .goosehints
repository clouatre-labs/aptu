Patterns:
- thiserror for library errors, anyhow for application errors
- tracing with #[instrument] for async functions
- System keychain for tokens (never plaintext)
- XDG paths: ~/.config/aptu/, ~/.local/share/aptu/

Commands: auth, repos, issues, triage, history

Run tests with `cargo test`. Format with `cargo fmt`. Lint with `cargo clippy`.
